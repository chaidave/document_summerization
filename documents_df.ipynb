      "Yemen have not reported for the past 5 years. In cases of non-reporting , the World Bank debt \n",

      "➢ The d ebtor  may  define external public debt  more narrowly than the DRS reporting mandat e. \n",

      "➢ Late interest and penalty interest are rarely reported to the DRS.  Part of the reason for this \n",

      "standards and definitions that underpin the DRS , thereby compromising both intra -creditor \n",
      "and debtor -creditor comparisons . \n",
      "➢ Potential double -countin g due to the inclusion of contingent liabilities . Some  creditors  \n",

The exercise compared basic loan information and debt stock positions reported by creditors with the data in the DRS. The findings revealed discrepancies between debtor and creditor records, which can be attributed to factors such as weak debt management, differences in reporting norms, and methodological inconsistencies.\n",

    "- The size of the U.S. CP market was $1,007 billion at the end of June 2020, which is a decrease from the all-time high of $2.2 trillion in July 2007. The decline is primarily due to a reduction in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issuance.\n",
    "- The main CP issuers as of June 2020 were non-U.S. financial and other firms, accounting for 43% the total CP outstanding. U.S. financial firms accounted for 19%, nonfinancial firms accounted for 17%, and ABCP accounted for 21%.\n",
    "- Various institutional investors participate in the CP market, including nonfinancial firms (25% percent of total CP market), money market funds (22%), mutual funds (10%), state and local governments (7%), pension accounts (5%), and other smaller investors.\n",
    "- Money market funds (MMFs) used to account for a larger share of the CP market but have declined over the last 20 years. Assets under management in government MMFs, which do not invest in the CP market, have grown, resulting in lower demand for CP from MMFs.\n",
    "- In mid-March 2020, CP rates increased, potentially due to a lack of investor demand and the market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prime MMFs and short-term corporate bond mutual funds experienced significant outflows.\n",
    "- The Federal Reserve established the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) in March 2020 to support the flow of credit. MMLF provides loans to banks to finance assets purchased from MMFs. The outstanding amount of MMLF loans has been declining since April, and as of September 30, 2020, the total amount of outstanding loans was around $7 billion.\n",

      "Notable Literary Styles and Elements in Poe’s Works Edgar Allan Poe is a prominent figure in gothic literature due to his immense knowledge of the genre and calculated approaches to leading his audience into a dreary, gloomy, horrific, creepy, and dark environment. A majority of his short stories including Tell-Tale Heart, The Pit and the Pendulum, Masque of the Red Death, and The Black Cat share gothic attributes that serve to instill fear into the readers (Szabo et al 2). For example, a gothic poem by the author that most people are familiar with is The Raven. In its sense, a raven is a gothic creature used in horror movies and horror stories to foretell danger and send shivers down individuals’ spines. Moreover, the poem describes the narrator’s feelings of fear from the beginning, which plays a crucial role in creating a mood that is sustained throughout the poem (Szabo et al 4). However, Poe adopts unique strategies to inform his audience of the poems setting and explain the horrific nature of the narrator’s environment.  One of the most common techniques that Poe used to catch the attention of his readers and engage them in the plot is a vivid description. Poe thoroughly describes the gothic settings in his short stories and poems without leaving out the finer details. For example, in The Raven, Poe introduces his audience to the narrator who is sitting alone around a fire in a library filled with books and gothic Pallas (Purbo et al. 6). Another gothic poem where the author adopts this approach is Alone, featuring a narrator who feels alone according to his perceptions. Even though the narrator is in contact with other people, he feels different because his likings and interests do not resonate with others’ preferences. Nevertheless, the poem has several gothic elements that are observable in most of his works including lightning, storms, thunder, and demons that haunt their victims (Szabo et al 5). Moreover, his poem’s gothic attributes include intense emotions, feelings of detachment from reality and other people, and strong interpersonal bonds associated with love, melancholy, madness, terror, and death.  Poe’s works also share a similar and definite structure. It is essential to note that Edgar Poe did not become a prominent artist because of his expressions and inner description of real-life characters in their immediate surroundings. Instead, the structure of his work significantly grabs its audience’s attention. According to the author, literary works should not be too long regardless of whether it is a novel or a poem (Purbo et al. 7). Although an ideal length is not specified, the author suggests that creators should adhere to one rule, i.e., the presentation should be readable in one sitting. As a result, most of his works quickly rush into action by first introducing the readers to the situation and the dilemma in place. From the beginning, the author sustains a tempo that ultimately builds to the climax and the resolution (Purbo et al. 7). Seemingly, his technique was effective in inducing tension  and enabling the audience to engage with his plot throughout. This technique allowed him to rise to notable ranks as he became a well-known author, magazine critic, and editor.  The unnamed speaker or the first person point of view is also a notable feature of most of Poe’s works as there are a few poems and stories where he names the narrator. During Poe’s time, it was unusual to see a story that began with a narrator’s confession. Nevertheless, Poe uses the narrator as the focal point of most of his stories and poems as they play a major role in building the plot (Shehabat et al. 357). For example, The Black Cat and Manuscript Found in a Bottle are works that begin with a description of the narrator’s mindset. In other stories, this approach is followed by a short introduction of the narrator’s environment and the circumstances that led to his often challenging position (Shehabat et al. 359). In A Tell-Tale Heart, the narrator proclaims his sanity after confessing to having killed a man. This approach is critical to the story’s development because it allows the audience to share his perceptions and understand \n",
      "the implications of the characters’ actions on their sanity. Thus, his technique shaped the nature and feel of his stories as it enhances reader engagement.  Another notable attribute of Poe’s fiction is how he uses individuals’ hatred to propel their actions and provide a motive for crimes. Hatred is a feature that can be identified in A Tell-Tale Heart, William Wilson, The Cask of Amontillado, and The Black Cat all feature aspects of hate, including hatred sown towards a doppelganger who turned out to be the narrator. According to Winters, Poe was trying to show how this immense feeling can be destructive, especially when they consume an individual who is insane (p 7). Hate is the force that drives the narrator of The Cask of Amontillado to commit murder and hide dead bodies in strange places. However, Poe has several other stories where deep emotions drive characters to commit gruesome acts and conceal corpses to avoid getting caught. For example, the narrator hides a dead old man under a floorboard. On the other hand, the narrator in The Black Cat hid his wife behind plaster walls in a cellar. Moreover, The Murders in the Rue Morgue feature a gang that shaves the body of a young lady up a chimney (Winters 14). As a result, the author is successful in elaborating the heinous acts that human beings can engage in due to emotions that are beyond their control and judgment.  Edgar Poe is also known for his heavy adoption of similes and symbolism to depict the nature of his stories’ settings, individuals’ feelings, and various other aspects. Symbolism is a literary element that describes instances when an author uses an object to refer to something different (Purbo 4). In The Tell-Tale Heart Poe uses the beating heart and the old man’s eye as symbols. The narrator is obsessed with the eye and he thinks that it resembles that of a vulture. The plot suggests that whenever the narrator takes a look at it, he shivers, and becomes fearful, and cold. The eye had a significant impact on the narrator’s well-being that he killed the old man. As a result, the eye is depicted as an object of evil.  The beating heart is also used as a symbol to represent the narrator’s conscience (Shehabat et al. 358) After killing the old man, the narrator can still hear his heart beating loudly and the loud noise exasperates his guilt. Ultimately, the old man’s beating heart pushes him to reveal his dead body and confess.  On the other hand, a simile uses comparisons and links items with the words ‘as’ or ‘like’. Poe incorporates several similes into his stories, which play a crucial role as they enhance a reader’s understanding and perception of the plot’s scene. For example, in The Tell-Tale Heart, the narrator goes into the old man’s room and describes it as ”black as pitch” (Shehabat et al. 360). Thus, this encourages him to light up his lantern so that he can see his movements and where he is going. As soon as he gets his lantern, Poe notes that a dim ray, like a spider’s thread, shoots out from the crevice and falls upon the man’s eye, which looks like a vulture’s. Therefore, similes allow him to enhance his imagery and provide the audience with deeper insight into the emotions and actions of his characters. Similes also enrich the story’s texture as it allows the audience to resonate with the situation and get a clear picture of the proceedings. Therefore, they are a critical element in his thriller and horror stories.  Irony is also a critical component of Poe’s short stories and poems as most of his stories end in the exact opposite of individuals’ anticipation. Irony in Poe’s works varies and may be displayed through ironic situations or individuals’ actions. A notable example of irony can be found in The Cask of Amontillado when one of the characters, Montressor, shows increased concern over the well-being and health of Fortunato when his real plans are to kill him (Hecker 12). It is also ironic that the enemy of Montressor was named Fortunato, which means fortunate in Spanish because of the story’s ending. Rather than escaping the ordeal that was about to meet him, he was unlucky and was buried alive behind a wall. However, Hecker notes that apart from irony, Poe’s literary works are also based on scientific concepts as the author is convinced that science is destructive to the world of myths, tales, and fables (p 16). As a result, he applies various scientific concepts and techniques, especially in solving heinous crimes.  \n",
      "In addition, one of Poe’s most significant traits was his ability to come up with twisted characters and questionable narrators. Poe preferred incorporating mental disease and human conditions into several of his short stories. As one of the first individuals to adopt this methodology, Poe influenced many aspects of modern-day horror movies (Yousef 255). Most modern horror films feature horrific tales of individuals detached from reality and suffering from emotional, physical, and social distress. These films strive to show that there is a horrific force in human beings that is difficult to control. Sad to note, these images resemble the nature of modern-day America and the mental issues that individuals go through (Yousef 257). However, the intense emotions and often gruesome reparations forecast the potential implications of neglecting the needs of these individuals. Mental  disorders are highly prevalent in Poe’s works that one may find it hard to trust the sanity of other characters. Nevertheless, his approaches allowed him to create thrilling stories that included several themes including love, sacrifice, human conflicts, and good vs. evil.  Finally, a vital element of Poe’s work that one can only acknowledge after hearing words from the poem is his melodic tendencies. Poe could play with words and sounds, thus allowing him to fill his work with musical attributes. In most of his poems, he adopts alliteration, rhyme schemes, and repetition to enhance the rhythm. According to Kennedy, Poe was convinced that sound and melodic lines play a critical role in the whole poem (p 18). In his essay titled The Poetic Principle, Poe suggests that musical features like rhythm, modes of meter, and rhyme, should never be rejected in poetry. Poe proposes that these factors are essential to poetry composition, suggesting that it would be silly to decline their assistance (Kennedy 19). Thus, he advocated for the use of these musical elements in poetry, allowing them to become standard writing and composition components.  \n"

      "Immigration and Homeland Security in the US Abstract : The contradictory provisions of organizations striving to establish national security in the United States of America and the needs for attracting highly qualiﬁed immigrants serve as the essence of the ongoing debate. It is established that these requirements are readjusted following laws and speciﬁc executive orders. The former is the framework for all solutions to the emerging challenges related to these two aspects, whereas the latter expresses particular views of presidents on the appropriateness of measures. In this context, the political course of Donald Trump and Joe Biden is discussed to demonstrate the two extremes: imposing restrictions and facilitating immigration for boosting the economy. These options are considered suitable if they can be readjusted depending on the conditions of the external environment in a ﬂexible manner. The analysis of the speciﬁed challenge allows making recommendations on how to effectively ﬁnd a balance between national security and immigration in the United States. First, it is suggested to distinguish between different categories of newcomers to properly assess the beneﬁts they might bring. Second, supporting various types of documents and visas for the described decision is critical to avoid adversities related to the possibility of terrorism or committing crimes. Third, the respect for liberties for all American residents regardless of their legal status alongside eliminating the risks of proﬁling leads to improvements in the environment. These ideas are underpinned by biblical wisdom, according to which fair treatment of all individuals is vital for everyone’s prosperity. This statement is complemented by the Christian perspective on the reasonability of viewing God’s providence as one of the principal factors contributing to immigration in the country. K e y w o r d s : national security, immigration system, Christian perspective, conﬂicting political decisions. Introduction The challenge of ensuring the safety of all citizens in the United States of America is a multi-faceted problem complicated by the accompanying risks for newcomers. These obstacles are linked to the interrelation between the task of guaranteeing\n",
      "homeland security and the need for attracting highly qualiﬁed specialists to the country. From this perspective, establishing a balance between the above ﬁelds is required; meanwhile, it is almost impossible to achieve in practice. The reasons for this failure are usually connected to the rapidly evolving environment in which the authorities act for the beneﬁt of all individuals and the lack of agreement among them. Therefore, homeland security can be promoted only if the adopted measures are uniform and do not change following single opinions of political leaders while effectively addressing the needs of both the country and the newcomers. The Current State of Laws and Executive Orders The performance of the described tasks is typically guided by the existing legal provisions, which are used as a framework for the activity of initiators of the corresponding processes. In this case, immigration laws are useful for this purpose regardless of their seeming controversy stemming from the speciﬁcities of perceptions at the time of their creation. For instance, there is a variety of acts that are still referred to as the basis for other solutions suggested by the presidents, and they are selected with respect to their personal opinions. Thus, the political course developed by Donald Trump during his term was underpinned by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, according to which prioritizing different categories of newcomers is the key to homeland security (Kerwin & Warren, 2017). It also correlated with the provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which provided for the possibility of enforcing borders due to accessing authorized funding (Kerwin & Warren, 2017). In other words, the imposed restrictions were in compliance with the previously adopted bills that are still used for this objective. From this perspective, the idea of a national emergency presented by Trump caused harm to the existing immigration system while being characterized by dubious efﬁciency. It was supported by a number of executive orders, including those allowing for the construction of the wall between the United States and Mexico and supporting the Muslim Ban (Kashyap, 2019). These decisions reﬂecting the president’s concerns were claimed to be rational, and the declaration of a critical situation made on February 15, 2019, helped secure funding for the implementation of these projects (Kashyap, 2019). However, they showed only one aspect of the matter while neglecting the beneﬁts of attracting immigrants to the country.\n",
      "The opposing perspective on these political shifts in relation to the issue of homeland security was presented by the Biden-Harris administration, and it currently determines the actions of the government in this respect. The president’s focus is on the advantages new people might bring to the United States and, more speciﬁcally, their value as a workforce (Kerwin et al., 2021). Since the orientation is on improved naturalization and the ongoing integration of immigrants in the country, his actions can also be viewed through the lens of corresponding bills. Hence, the US Citizenship Act corresponds to his activity alongside the ideas included in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, such as the legalization of hiring employees from abroad (Kerwin et al., 2021; Kerwin & Warren, 2017). In contrast to Trump’s strategies concerning limitations, Biden’s approach, which is more friendly to foreigners, does not mean that the president neglects the considerations of the safety of Americans. Thus, Biden’s administration elaborated different executive orders addressing this aspect. In this area, the solutions were clearly determining what kind of people are suitable for immigration and what conditions should be followed during employment (Kerwin et al., 2021). Another statement prepared by the president was the claim of foreigners’ economic contributions and other beneﬁts of their participation in the life of communities (Kerwin et al., 2021). These actions seem effective; nevertheless, additional mechanisms for ensuring homeland security seem necessary. Apparently, the conducted work on eliminating discrimination is clearly advantageous, and religious tolerance emphasized in these documents correlates with the Christian perspective of fairness (“Exodus 12:49,” n.d.). When complemented by the introduction of more detailed criteria rather than background and language mastery, it will be more positive than Trump’s past suggestions. The Impact of Legal Provisions on Homeland Security The legal provisions described above present two extremes, and their impact on homeland security varies accordingly. Thus, the primary focus on developing limitations regardless of their actual feasibility and applicability to the country’s needs concerning qualiﬁed workforce has a predominantly economic inﬂuence (Kashyap, 2019). For instance, the absence of specialists in any ﬁeld critical for the overall well-being of American citizens, such as healthcare, inevitably results in the worsening of their living standards. In this situation, the promotion of restrictive policies in terms of immigration allegedly harms everyone, both current residents\n",
      "and newcomers, who can thereby potentially improve their position in the workplace (Kerwin, 2018). Consequently, the concerns related to the safety of individuals in the country contradict the expected outcomes of such policies and do not contribute to people’s positive reactions to these shifts. In contrast to this stance, the ideas of eliminating obstacles for immigrants while emphasizing the need for their proper assessments regarding the suitability to the needs of the United States undoubtedly affect public sentiment. They add to the respect for American democracy, which was frequently violated by speciﬁc legal provisions related to foreigners throughout history (Kerwin & Warren, 2017). In addition, the economy signiﬁcantly beneﬁts from the involvement of new specialists, which is especially vital in the context of rapidly evolving market conditions. They lead to the emergence of the requirement to possess speciﬁc skills and abilities for higher proﬁts, and attracting immigrants for this purpose is a more favorable solution from the perspective of the collective good (Kerwin & Warren, 2017). As a result, the government obtains more resources for establishing homeland security for its citizens. Thus, the initiative in distinguishing between the potential terrorists and individuals useful for society is better performed with regard to evaluating particular characteristics and acting accordingly while being properly funded. Options for Guaranteeing Homeland Security Considering the above factors, it is feasible to discuss options that are most applicable to maintaining a balance between people’s needs and their safety as it is supposed to be guaranteed by the government. The speciﬁed approaches to this task are reported to have varying degrees of effectiveness; however, despite the alleged beneﬁts of measures preferred by Biden, it is impossible to claim their appropriateness to any case. Thus, for example, the idea of fair treatment correlating the Bible’s provisions and advantages for different areas of societal life might not be optimal during actual crises. In this situation, careful examination of external circumstances for revealing actual threats is desirable. Meanwhile, the perceived hazards should not substitute rational methods, as it happened during Trump’s presidency, as no evidence of the need to build the border wall was presented other than generalized assumptions. The selection of a proper political course in this respect implies shifting between the described options while referring to the main direction for ensuring homeland\n",
      "security. According to the national strategy based on the necessity to prevent terrorism in the United States, the key factors include the efﬁciency of one or another solution to the predetermined targets (Homeland Security Council, 2007). These directions are disrupting the potential attacks, protecting the available resources, and promoting recovery from adverse events of this nature alongside the orientation of the lasting effects of the adopted measures (Homeland Security Council, 2007). In other words, fair treatment should be the main focus of policymakers, excluding cases of the conﬁrmed risks, which should not be erroneously perceived as discrimination against speciﬁc population groups. The Suggested Changes in the Policies and Alternatives The proposed ﬂexible way of managing the needs of citizens regarding their security and the economic beneﬁts of immigration can be substituted or complemented by a number of alternatives to the solutions described above. They include the idea of ﬁxing the current system, which is referred to by scholars as broken, by distinguishing between different categories of newcomers and presenting a uniform approach to the problem for all states (Kerwin & Warren, 2017). In the former case, the possibility of achieving a consensus on the political course corresponds to the feasibility of clarifying the nature of a person’s permission to stay in the country. In other words, undocumented immigrants should not be treated in a similar manner as refugees or asylum seekers (Kerwin & Warren, 2017). The intention to examine their situations on an individual basis complies with the security needs and, therefore, should be respected. As for the introduction of the same measures in all states, this necessity is conditional upon the lack of cooperation between them, leading to the dubious efﬁciency of immigration policies. The failure to respect this condition, as follows from Trump’s course on family separation when entering the country at a port different from that claimed in applications, has a tremendous impact on people’s well-being (Kashyap, 2019). What is more important, the absence of a mechanism addressing their psychological trauma explains the need for better cooperation (Kashyap, 2019). From this standpoint, an alternative of humane treatment of all people regardless of the states’ vulnerability of strengths seems critical for avoiding the mentioned negative outcomes (Kerwin & Warren, 2017). Also, this idea does\n",
      "not pose a threat to homeland security since the affected persons are to be subject to the same procedures upon arrival. The additional changes in immigration legislation and practices stemming from it are paying particular attention to documents and highlighting the fact that liberties available to American citizens are equally attributed to newcomers. The former recommendation is vital for revealing the contributions of foreigners to different aspects of societal life. For instance, distinguishing between family-based visas and those of individuals is critical as their importance for the United States varies depending on their occupations (Kerwin & Warren, 2017). Therefore, it is not advisable to apply the same requirements for minors and potential employees in companies throughout the country, and their documents should not be viewed as comparable (Jiang & Erez, 2018). In this situation, the only necessity is to provide for analysis of those events when visas do not comply with any regulations, implying the likelihood of committing crimes. Moreover, the need for claiming access to liberties provided by the citizenship of the United States since the arrival of immigrants is crucial for avoiding discrimination. This phenomenon is previously discussed by Kashyar (2019) when investigating the situation of Muslim men, implying the presence of proﬁling. It is also conﬁrmed by the requirement of establishing easier procedures when no direct threat is expressed in the assessment conducted by Kerwin and Warren (2017). The attention of researchers to the matter means that it is crucial for addressing both individual and public needs while balancing between safety and opportunities provided to everyone regardless of personal characteristics. Christian Perspective on Appropriateness of Practices The discussed challenges in ﬁnding a compromise between the intention to protect citizens from terrorism and ensure that everyone is treated in a fair manner within the existing immigration system correlate with the Christian perspective. Thus, they can be viewed through the lens of the biblical wisdom applicable to the case. One of the principles that should be respected when approaching the problem is expressed in Exodus 12:49 (n.d.), and it states that “the same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who resides among you.” This stance means that it is important to remember that all people are equal regardless of their origin. In other words, one’s background should not be viewed as a threat in the absence of other circumstances serving as opposing evidence.\n",
      "In addition, homeland security affecting the state of the current immigration system in the United States should be organized with respect for the necessity to take into consideration external circumstances related to God’s providence. As it is written in Genesis 12:1 (n.d.), “Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country, And from your relatives And from your father’s house, To the land which I will show you.” It means that people’s personal plans are not always the key motivation in moving to the country. This intention can be guided by higher forces, and contradicting them correlates with neglecting the design of events that are to happen for everyone’s beneﬁt. In this way, the considerations of safety should not prevent individuals from fulﬁlling their mission in life.\n"
